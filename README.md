# Bose-Einstein-Condensate-NN

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that generate simulated images of Bose-Einstein Condensates and characterize them using TensorFlow and other data analysis libraries.

[Here](https://github.com/alec-gironda/Bose-Einstein-Condensate-NN/blob/main/BEC_ThermalCloud_NN.ipynb) is the most updated Jupyter Notebook that allows the user to interactively generate data and train a neural network to predict the temperature of an atom cloud based on the image.

[Here](https://github.com/alec-gironda/Bose-Einstein-Condensate-NN/blob/main/generate_bec_thermal_cloud_nn_data.py) is the most updated Python script that generates simulated experimental images including a Bose-Einstein Condensate and a thermal cloud.

[Here](https://github.com/alec-gironda/Bose-Einstein-Condensate-NN/blob/main/BEC_Derivations.pdf) is a PDF of the derivation for the equation used to generate simulated experimental images of atom clouds.
